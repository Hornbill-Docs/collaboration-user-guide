# Managing Workspaces
As the owner of a workspace you can configure it's attributes and manage it's members.

## Managing Workspaces as an owner
The Configure Link will be visible only to the owner of the workspace.

## Configure
Configure the attributes of your workspace including Billboard notices, and reassignment of ownership.

* Add a Billboard Notice which will appear at the top of my workspace, this can include links etc and supports wiki markup.
* Choose to enable, or disable the Billboard notice as needed.
* Delete when finished with the Billboard notice.
* Name & Description - Change the display name and description (purpose of the workspace).
* **Owner**. Reassign ownership of the workspace to another user.
* **Type**. Set the workspace type to either Public, or Private.
* **Delete**. Permanently delete the workspace.

## Members
As the owner of a workspace you can add users to the workspace.

* Use the Search option to find and add the users
* **Add Silently**. By ticking the add silently button any new users added to the workspace will not be announced via a post to the workspace Buzz, and existing member will not receive a notification about the new member(s).
* **Add Everyone**. Choosing this option will add all users to the workspace, this is useful when you have company wide workspaces.
