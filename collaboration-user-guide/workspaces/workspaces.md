# Workspaces
A Workspace is a place where you can bring together a group of Users to collaborate around a common topic. Workspaces are made up of Posts and Comments on it's activity stream. You can set up a workspace about any relevant theme that you want to share with others in your organization. Add images, videos, links, ask questions, or just write a comment. It is a great place to keep informed and up to date.

## Workspace Lists
The Workspaces page allows you to view the available workspaces, add new workspaces, and manage the workspaces that you own. The Workspaces page is accessed from the Home Menu and selecting the option Workspaces

* **My Workspaces**<br>Workspaces that you are a member of, including workspaces you own. This is the default list when you first come to the Workspaces.

* **Owned Workspaces**<br>Workspaces that you have created and you are the owner. Use this list to help manage the workspaces that you own.

* **Public Workspaces**<br>A list of workspaces that are Public and you are not yet a member.

## Create a Workspace
If you want to create a new workspace to provide an area to discuss a topic or area of the business, you can create a workspace and add members whom you want as part of your discussion. To add a new workspace, click on the Create Workspace button on the Workspace List toolbar.

* **Workspace Name**<br>This will be the name that is displayed in any list where this Workspace can be seen.
* **Workspace Description**<br>Worthwhile having a good description of your workspace, especially in a public workspace. The description will let a user know what your workspace is all about when viewing the list of Public Workspaces.
* **Add Members**<br>You can add individual Users, members of a Role, or members of a Group to your workspace.
* **Type of Workspace**<br>Depending on the content of a Workspace, you can select a workspace Type to control who has access.
    * ***Open***<br>An open workspace is visible to everyone. It appears in the list of Open Workspaces, and you can see what people have posted in it, and who are members. Anyone can join an Open workspace.
    * ***Secret***<br>Secret workspaces are only visible to members. It only appears in a list of workspaces if you are a member. You cannot join a private workspace yourself - only the owner can add you as a member.

## Join a Workspace
When viewing the list of public workspaces, a Join option is available on each listed Workspace. Clicking this button will add you as a member and provide an entry in the workspace, letting others know that you have joined.

You may also want to have a browse of the Workspace before joining. Clicking on the Workspace Name will open that workspace where you can see and read some of the posts to get an idea of what the workspace is all about. Here too has an option to Join. In addition to this, a Silently option for joining is available which will prevent a post from being added to the workspaces announcing your new membership.
